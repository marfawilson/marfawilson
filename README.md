# Welcome to my profile!✨


Howdy! I'm an aspiring Web Developer in Austin, Texas. I began my coding journey in the early days of social media editing the HTML of my Myspace page. Technology has come a long way, and I'm excited to be a part of this coding world full of never ending learning and growth.🪴
